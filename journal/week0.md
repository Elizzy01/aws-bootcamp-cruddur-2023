# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Prerequisities
 - Created AWS account for the bootcamp
 - Created Github repo
 - Set up Gitpod account 

## Required Homework
1. Attended the live stream
2. Watched the follow up videos for Week 0 - Generating credentials, Budget, Billing Alarms, AWS CLI videos
3. Took certain security considerations on setting up the account
  - I set up an AWS organization and my bootcamp account as a sub-account.
  - I activated MFA

  - I gave my user admin role.

4. I created Architectural diagram, both the **Conceptual** and the **Logical** diagrams on Lucid Chart. I also did a little work with napkin.
