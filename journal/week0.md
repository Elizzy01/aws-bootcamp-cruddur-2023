# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Prerequisities
 - Created AWS account for the bootcamp
 - Created Github repo
 - Set up Gitpod account 

## Required Homework
1. Attended the live stream
2. Watched the follow up videos for Week 0 - Generating credentials, Budget, Billing Alarms, AWS CLI videos

### Account security
3. Took certain security considerations on setting up the account
    - I set up an AWS organization and my bootcamp account as a sub-account. - *Even though I had created the account some months back. I retained the account because I have some credits on it which I would like to use for the bootcamp.*
    - I activated MFA on my account and root account using a virtual MFA app on my mobile phone called **Authy by Twilio**

    - I gave my user admin role.

### Architecture Diagrams

4. I created Architectural diagram, both the **Conceptual** and the **Logical** diagrams on Lucid Chart. I also did a little work with napkin.

5.Used Cloudshell in us-east-1 region and it worked so well. :)

6. I created Access key on my IAM console under the user security credentials. I then used Generated AWS Credentials - Access Key/Secret pair for cruddur-admin user. Added persistent Gitpod variables to store AWS credentials for resuse using these commands:

`gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" 
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""`
